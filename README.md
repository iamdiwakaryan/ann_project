# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN & Streamlit

This project builds and deploys an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service). The trained model is integrated into an interactive Streamlit web application that accepts user inputs and returns churn predictions.

##  Project Features

- Trained ANN model for binary classification (churn vs. no churn)
- Hyperparameter tuning to achieve **86% prediction accuracy**
- Deployed as a user-friendly **Streamlit web app**
- Handles preprocessing (encoding + scaling) on user input before prediction
- Clean modular design with reusable saved encoders and scaler
